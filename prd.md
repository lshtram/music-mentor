# Music Learning & Recommendation App – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

**Working Name:** SoundPath (placeholder)

**Vision**  
Build an AI-powered application for *learning about music through intentional album listening*.  
The app combines a **user-editable prompt** with the user’s **entire listening history** to generate continuously refined album recommendations across *all musical genres*.

This is not a streaming service, a playlist generator, or a social network.  
It is a *personal music learning environment* where albums are treated as cultural objects—read about, reflected on, and revisited.

---

## 2. Core Concept

- The user always sees **exactly 5 album recommendations**
- Recommendations are generated by AI using:
  - A **free-text prompt** (editable by the user)
  - The user’s **complete listening and rating history**
- The system continuously replenishes recommendations so the list is always full
- Any interaction (except “Skip”) moves albums into a permanent **Library**

---

## 3. Target Users

### Primary Users
- Curious, reflective listeners
- Music learners exploring genres, eras, movements
- Experienced listeners dissatisfied with opaque streaming algorithms
- Users comfortable interacting with AI via prompts

### Non-Target Users
- Passive listeners
- Users seeking background playlists
- Social or community-driven discovery seekers

---

## 4. Key Product Principles

1. **Prompt-Centered Control**  
   The recommendation logic is explicit, editable, and user-directed.

2. **Finite by Design**  
   No infinite feeds. No scrolling discovery. Always five.

3. **Album-Centric Learning**  
   Albums are the fundamental unit, not tracks or playlists.

4. **Persistent Memory**  
   The library is cumulative and never resets.

5. **Explainability**  
   Recommendations must include contextual explanations and criticism.

---

## 5. App Architecture

### Primary Screens
- **Recommendations**
- **Library**
- (Secondary) Artist detail view
- (External) Review source pages (browser)

---

## 6. Recommendation Screen

### 6.1 Prompt Editor

- Text-edit window at the top of the screen
- Pre-filled with a default AI prompt (editable)
- User can freely modify the prompt at any time
- Saving the prompt triggers:
  - Immediate regeneration of all recommendations

**Example prompt content (illustrative):**
> Recommend albums that explore minimalism and repetition, across genres, with emotional depth. Avoid mainstream pop.

---

### 6.2 Recommendation List

- Always exactly **5 album cards**
- If the user removes or marks an album, a new one is generated instantly

---

### 6.3 Album Card Structure

Each album card includes:

- Album cover image (real artwork)
- Album title
- Artist name (clickable → Artist Card)
- Short AI-generated album summary
- Critics’ review excerpts
  - Expandable
  - Each review is clickable and opens the original source in a browser

---

### 6.4 Album Actions

Each album card includes the following actions:

- **Play**
  - Open album in Apple Music or Spotify (based on user preference)
- **Mark as Listened**
- **Rate (1–5 stars)**
- **Skip**

#### Behavioral Rules
- *Listened* or *Rated* → album moves to Library
- *Skip* → album is discarded and does NOT enter the Library
- After any action, the system regenerates recommendations to maintain 5 cards

---

## 7. Artist Card (Secondary View)

- Triggered by clicking artist name
- Displays:
  - Artist bio
  - List of albums already recommended or in Library
